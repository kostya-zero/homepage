**Hi there!** Hope you're doing well.


This is my first blog post after I've figured out how MDX is working in Next.js.
I've been struggling about what to use, but decided to use plain MDX files and read them from server disk.

What is more interesting is that this was built in **one day**.
It was quiet simple.
It thought it would be really hard to actually do this.

I am not going to attach kind of comments or whatever to the posts *(maybe in near future)* because I still trying to stablize the system that powers this.

### Why not writing backend?

I don't think this is really needed for this tiny thing.
A backend should be used if there is multiple users that uses this blog. 

But I am the only user.

Despite I've started learning Golang, I thought that it will be better to use built-in tools that Next.js provides instead of writing a huge business logic.

### What's next?

Posts about my programming journey, tools that I use, my personal thought, and many more!

Also, I want to practice my English, as it's not my native language. Sorry if I am writing bad sometimes!

**See you later!**

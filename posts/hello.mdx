**Hi there!** Hope you're doing well.

This is my first blog post after figuring out how MDX works in Next.js.
I've been struggling what to use, but decided to use plain MDX files and read them from server disk.

To my surpise, it turned out to be quite easy.

I'm not going to any comments or similar features to the posts, because I'm still trying to stablize the system.

### Why not write a backend?

I don't think this is really needed for this tiny thing.
A backend would make sense if there were multiple users using this blog.

But I am the only user.

Even though I've started learning Go, I thought that it will be better to use built-in tools that Next.js provides instead of building additional business logic.

### What's next?

Posts about my programming journey, the tools I use, my personal thoughts, and much more.

I also want to practice my English, since it's not my native language. Sorry if I sometimes write badly.

**See you later!**
